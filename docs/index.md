***Here excellence develops, we learn to develop and design world.***

## Note :
    we want you to use multiple IDE for learning, this verifies your code portability.

## Programming in C :
### Pre requirement :
No prior programming knowledge is required.
It will be helpful if you have programmed before in any language but it is optional
