## Thanks and Love to you all
Firstly, I want to thank all my team mates, who made this project possible.
The great inspiration and co-ordination of my team mates encouraged me 
to burn midnight oil. 

The success always brings a feeling of joy, and 
the failures always teach the path to success. The same happened while working on this project.
The journey was quite enlightning. The content was generated from experience. The definitions or
any piece of text used in this project is not copied from any book or article. 

The complete project is based on practical approach and is written as per my experience.  

I believe that failures are most important in our life, because they provide us an opportunity to shine.
While, reading the content, you will experience such mile stones.

The path taken by us to write and teach the content is the hard way, because we want you to experiment 
as much as possible.

After combining your efforts with our efforts, you will definitely achieve a goal that will,
make you stand on top of this world.

Now, I want to thank of some most respected personalities for me. 
These personalites permitted me with their blessings and support.

1. My parents and my teachers, who encouraged me to contribute in this world.
2. My friends and my team mates, who provided me an opportunity to learn new skills and teach them to the world.
3. All my viewers, students and you, who is currently supporting the project.
